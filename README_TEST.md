## Front-end
Left and right chat window/box. Left sends message to right, vice versa. When one sends message, the other  window flashes. Keep all messages so even when we close the tab and reopen it, old messages are there. Use nodejs and nextjs with only necessary libraries. Use a websocket implementation.

## Back-end
Build a Python app that scrapes all types of Pokemon into local database, and make them available to view using API, use jsonapi standards.
Use Python and only necessary libraries. 

## Full-stack
See 2 above and have the left and right chat always sends ONE pokemon detail on every chat sent. Example:
```
left: hello
left: Charmander details from API
right: hi how are you
right: Squirtle details from API
```

## Mobile iOS & Android
Full screen chat window/box, swipe left/right to switch between windows. Left sends message to right, vice versa. When one sends message, the other  window flashes. Keep all messages so even when we close the tab and reopen it, old messages are there. Use native app development and only necessary libraries.

## Closing

If you have any questions, don't contact us, make an assumption and include the assumptions in the README file.

Best of luck!
